# ACP Integration

Hanbao supports **ACP (Agent Client Protocol)** in two complementary ways:

1. **Hanbao using ACP as a Tool**: Hanbao connects to external ACP runners and uses them as delegated collaborators
2. **Hanbao as an ACP Server**: external clients connect to Hanbao over ACP

This page explains both modes and the scenarios each one fits best.

---

## Hanbao using ACP as a Tool

In this mode, Hanbao acts as an **ACP client / orchestrator**, connecting to **configured and enabled external ACP runners** and bringing them into the current session as delegated collaboration capabilities.

The actual entry point for this mode is the built-in tool `delegate_external_agent`. It is intended for scenarios where Hanbao needs to collaborate with other ACP-capable external agent runtimes, such as the built-in examples `opencode`, `qwen_code`, `claude_code`, and `codex`. For more ACP-compatible agents, see the official ACP agent list and integration guide: <https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents>. In other words, Hanbao does not directly talk to arbitrary external agents. It talks to runners that have been registered in ACP configuration, and it starts, continues, responds to, and closes delegated collaboration sessions through them.

### What this mode does

In this mode, Hanbao uses the built-in `delegate_external_agent` tool to:

- start a session with an external ACP runner
- send follow-up messages to that runner
- respond to permission requests raised by that runner
- close the delegated session when the work is complete

Conceptually, this lets Hanbao treat an external agent as a collaborative, tool-like capability while keeping Hanbao as the primary orchestrator of the main conversation.

### How to configure external runners

Before using an external runner, make sure you have installed an ACP-compatible external agent and completed any required login or API key setup so it can be launched and used normally from the command line. You can refer to the official ACP agent list here: <https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents>.

Once the command-line side is ready, you can configure a custom runner in Hanbao or collaborate with one of the built-in runners directly.

External runners must be configured and enabled on the **Workspace → ACP** page before they can be used by `delegate_external_agent`.

The current ACP configuration UI supports these fields for each runner:

- `enabled`
- `command`
- `args`
- `env`
- `trusted`
- `tool_parse_mode`
- `stdio_buffer_limit_bytes`

Specifically:

- `command` and `args` define the command and arguments used to launch the external runner;
- `env` passes environment variables;
- `tool_parse_mode` and `stdio_buffer_limit_bytes` control ACP output parsing and stdio buffering behavior. In most cases, the default values are fine and do not need to be changed.

On Linux/macOS, `command` is usually the command that starts the external agent in ACP mode, such as `opencode` or `qwen`, or the command that launches the corresponding ACP plugin, such as `npx`. Put the remaining flags and arguments in `args`, such as `--acp` or `-y`. Each argument must be entered on its own line. The source code ships with these built-in runner examples: `opencode`, `qwen_code`, `claude_code`, and `codex`. You can also add custom runners on the ACP page as long as they can run via ACP and are configured correctly.

On Windows, after confirming the external agent can be launched normally from the command line, set `command` to `cmd` and put `/c` as the first line in `args`, followed by the actual command and its arguments, again one per line. Example:

![config_win](https://gw.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01BDYXdk22Zt4726sHa_!!6000000007135-2-tps-1608-792.png)

After configuration, enable the `delegate_external_agent` tool in the toolbar.

![config](https://gw.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01XS6D6W1Yzap02Jnjk_!!6000000003130-2-tps-1224-700.png)

You can then explicitly specify which external agent you want to collaborate with in the conversation.

### Typical workflow

A typical delegated ACP workflow looks like this:

1. Configure and enable a runner on the **Workspace → ACP** page.
2. In a conversation, call `delegate_external_agent(action="start", runner="...", message="...")` to start a new delegated session for that runner.
3. If you want to continue the collaboration, call `delegate_external_agent(action="message", runner="...", message="...")` to send follow-up instructions to the existing runner session.
4. If the external runner raises a permission request, first let the user choose from the options shown in the UI, then call `delegate_external_agent(action="respond", runner="...", message="<exact option id>")` to resume execution. Here, `message` must be the **exact option id** returned by that permission request.
5. After the delegated work is complete, call `delegate_external_agent(action="close", runner="...")` to close the runner session.

You can pass task prompts such as "analyze the current working directory structure" or "write your self-introduction into a Markdown file" in `start` or `message`, but the underlying flow always maps to the same four actions: `start`, `message`, `respond`, and `close`.

### Supported delegated actions

The built-in delegation flow supports these action types:

| Action    | Purpose                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `start`   | Start a new delegated ACP session                                  |
| `message` | Send a follow-up message to an existing delegated session          |
| `respond` | Reply to a pending permission request using the selected option id |
| `close`   | Close the delegated ACP session                                    |

### Permission handling

When an external ACP runner asks for permission, Hanbao does **not** decide on the user's behalf.

Instead, it:

- pauses the delegated flow
- shows the permission details and available options
- waits for the user to choose how to proceed

This keeps delegated ACP execution aligned with the same user-controlled safety model used elsewhere in Hanbao.

### When to use ACP as a Tool

Use this mode when:

- you want Hanbao to collaborate with another agent runtime
- you have a specialized ACP-compatible external runner for a certain class of tasks
- you want Hanbao to remain the primary orchestrator while delegating part of the work outward

### ACP Tool vs MCP

ACP as a Tool and MCP solve different problems:

- **MCP** connects Hanbao to external services and tool servers
- **ACP as a Tool** connects Hanbao to an external **agent** runtime

If you need APIs, databases, filesystems, or service integrations, use **MCP**.
If you need agent-to-agent collaboration, use **ACP as a Tool**.

## Hanbao as an ACP Server

In this mode, Hanbao exposes itself as an [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/python-sdk) compliant agent service over stdio JSON-RPC. External clients, such as [Zed](https://zed.dev), [OpenCode](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/opencode), or any ACP-compatible editor, can connect to Hanbao via the `hanbao acp` command and interact with it programmatically.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start Hanbao as an ACP agent
hanbao acp

# Use a specific agent profile
hanbao acp --agent mybot

# Use a custom workspace directory
hanbao acp --workspace /path/to/workspace

# Enable debug logging to stderr
hanbao acp --debug
```

The process communicates over stdin/stdout using the ACP JSON-RPC protocol. stderr is used for logging.

### Supported ACP Methods

| Method              | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `initialize`        | Handshake that returns agent capabilities and version info   |
| `new_session`       | Create a new conversation session                            |
| `load_session`      | Load or attach to an existing session by ID                  |
| `resume_session`    | Resume a previously closed session                           |
| `list_sessions`     | List active sessions, optionally filtered by `cwd`           |
| `close_session`     | Close and clean up a session                                 |
| `prompt`            | Send a user message and stream back agent responses          |
| `set_session_model` | Switch the active LLM model, using `provider_id:model_id`    |
| `set_config_option` | Toggle session config options, such as the Tool Guard switch |
| `cancel`            | Cancel an in-progress `prompt`                               |

### Streaming Updates

During a `prompt` call, the agent streams real-time updates back to the client via `session_update` notifications:

| Update Type           | When                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_message_chunk` | Agent text response (streaming)             |
| `agent_thought_chunk` | Agent internal reasoning or system messages |
| `tool_call`           | Tool invocation started                     |
| `tool_call_update`    | Tool execution completed with output        |

### Declared Capabilities

The agent declares the following capabilities during `initialize`:

```json
{
  "load_session": true,
  "session_capabilities": {
    "close": {},
    "list": {},
    "resume": {}
  }
}
```

### Session Config Options

When a new session is created, the agent returns config options that the client can change via `set_config_option`:

| Config ID | Type   | Category | Default   | Options                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode`    | select | `mode`   | `default` | `default`: normal mode with Tool Guard enabled; `bypassPermissions`: skip tool guard checks |

### Configuration

The ACP agent resolves its configuration in the following order:

1. **CLI arguments**: `--agent` and `--workspace` take highest priority
2. **WORKING_DIR config**: read `agents.active_agent` from `config.json` inside `WORKING_DIR` (default `~/.hanbao`, or `~/.copaw` for legacy installations; overridable via the `HANBAO_WORKING_DIR` environment variable)
3. **Defaults**: fall back to agent ID `"default"` and workspace directory `WORKING_DIR/workspaces/default/`

## ACP Server vs ACP Tool

| Aspect               | Hanbao as an ACP Server                      | Hanbao using ACP as a Tool                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hanbao's role       | Server / target agent                         | Client / orchestrator                                  |
| Connection direction | External client connects to Hanbao           | Hanbao connects to an external runner                 |
| Main purpose         | Let editors or external clients drive Hanbao | Let Hanbao delegate work to another agent             |
| Typical entry point  | `hanbao acp`                                 | Delegation tool + ACP runner configuration             |
| Best for             | Editor integration, programmatic control      | Multi-agent collaboration, external specialist runners |

## Summary

ACP in Hanbao is not just one feature. It supports both directions:

- **Expose Hanbao outward** as an ACP server
- **Reach outward from Hanbao** to external ACP agents as delegated tools

If you are integrating Hanbao into another client, start with **ACP Server**.
If you want Hanbao to coordinate with another agent runtime, use **ACP as a Tool**.
